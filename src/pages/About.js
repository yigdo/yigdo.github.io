            back then. It made me learn the fundamentals like varibles and
            operators. Then I slowly progressed into web design. I made lots and
            lots of static html & css & js websites. I wanted to use
            authentication so I tried Firebase. It was somehow overwhelming for
            me. I discovered something called php after trying Firebase. It was
            like magic! I learned simple concepts and begged my mom to find a
            code mentor. I was 8-9 then. Many teachers declined me and said: "I
            am not a baby sitter maam" It broke my heart. One person however ({' '}

            ) made me learn php, laravel, mysql and more. I owe him many of my
            skills nowadays. I also introduced him to nodejs libraries like
            react and vue. He owes me those skills. Then, just about everything
            was great he abbandoned me. I had to survive myself. I created
            projects using laravel and created my own mvc library. Then me and
            my family searched for people who can share me their knowledge. I
            was looking for php mentors but I somehow started a c# course. Now I
            am here, writing my portfolio on react.{' '}
